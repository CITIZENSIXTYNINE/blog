## krisp's site

This repository contains all the source code for [krisp.sdf.org](https://krisp.sdf.org), you may also find this site by opening the "live-deployement" site at [iwearvans.tk](https://iwearvans.tk).

Due to my SDF account limitations (I'm not an ARPA/MetaARPA member), I have to compress the repo, upload it to 0x0.st, `curl` it into my SDF account/box, unzip it, move stuff into `html/` and then `mkhomepg -p`. Which is a pain in the ass when it comes to deployment, due to this I decided to put this repository on Netlify to have some kind of live-deployment in which other people can check the changes before I get around to uploading the site to SDF.

Also, come check out my new site over at [obama.solutions](https://obama.solutions/~nikki), and its source code. (WIP, because I'm still waiting on Cam to give me access to the damn thing.)

Powered by SDF.org and Netlify, I guess.
