## krisp's site

This repository contains all the source code for [krisp.sdf.org](https://krisp.sdf.org), you may also find this site by opening the live-deployement site at [iwearvans.tk](https://iwearvans.tk).

Due to my SDF account limitations' (I'm not an ARPA/MetaARPA member), I have to compress the repo, upload it to 0x0.st and  then `curl` it into my SDF account/box. Which is a pain in the ass when it comes to deployment, due to this I decided to put this repository on Netlify to have some kind of live-deployment in which other people can check the changes before I get around to uploading the site to SDF.

Powered by SDF.org and Netlify, i guess.
