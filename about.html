	<h1>Who is krisp? (Kris Pineda)</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Hello, my name is Kris, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg">I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy listening to avant-garde music and reheating Little Caesars Pizza.</a></p>
	<p>I'm currently working/wasting time as a <abbr title="Lead Hardware Engineer">Lead HWE</abbr> and Product Designer at <a href="https://gitgud.io/estrelar">Estrelar</a>; a 2-person lead startup that makes aero* stuff that could be considered as terrorism in some cases!</p>
	<p>I also used to work as a freelance video editor, it was fun but I didn't really like "not having control" on what I did; and I'm pretty shy when it comes to interacting with others so...</p>
	<p>I go by a lot of names online so you might get tangled up on who I actually am (I don't even know it myself!), so if you ever decide to datamine/dox me, have fun!</p>
	<p>In my free time, I like to do a lot of things, here is a list of them incase you care:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Play Team Fortress 2 (I have over 300 hours on it and I don't plan to stop)</li>
		<li>Take pictures for Wikimedia Commons</li>
		<li>Scream at pidgeons on the park</li>
		<li>Hunt for pedophiles in Telegram</li>
		<li>Go for really long walks</li>
		<li>Writing essays that nobody will ever read!</li>
		<li>Think about things that mentally stable people normally don't think about</li>
		<li><a href="https://twitter.com/lordvesconte">Shitpost in Twitter every thought that enters in my head</a></li>
		<li>Become obsessed with a band for 1 week and then forgetting they existed</li>
		<li>Learn something new and completely forget it in a month (how to use premiere?)</li>

		<li><del>send pipebombs with racial slurs to my mate matt</del></li>
		<li>Whine about how Mexico City has the best public transport in the world</li>
		<li>Recite whole-ass albums from memory (I'm good at remembering lyrics but not important details of my life!)</li>
	</ul>
