	<h1>Who is krisp? (Kris Pineda)</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Hello, my name is Kris, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg">I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy listening to avant-garde music and reheating Little Caesars Pizza.</a></p>
	<p>I'm currently working/wasting time as a <abbr title="Lead Hardware Engineer">Lead HWE</abbr> and Product Designer at <a href="https://gitgud.io/estrelar">Estrelar</a> making aerospace stuff, without a license of course (can't lose one if you don't have one!).</p>
	<p>I also used to work as a freelance video editor, it was fun for a while but it eventually became a toll on my mental health. Don't turn your passion into a career.</p>
	<p>Also, I go by a lot of names online so you might get tangled up on who I actually am (I don't even know it myself!), so for future reference, <a href="etc/names.html">use this list of names</a>.</p>
	<p>In my free time, I like to do a lot of things, here is a list with some of them in case you care:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Play Team Fortress 2 (I have over 400 hours and I don't plan to stop)</li>
		<li>Hunt for pedophiles in Telegram</li>
		<li>Go for really long walks</li>
		<li>Writing essays that nobody will ever read!</li>
		<li>Think about things that mentally stable people normally don't think about</li>
		<li><a href="https://twitter.com/lordvesconte">Shitpost in Twitter every thought that enters in my head</a></li>
		<li>Become obsessed with a band for 1 week and then forgetting they existed</li>
		<li>Learn something new and completely forget it in a month (how to use premiere?)</li>
		<li>Shitpost on /g/ about how Firefox is the best browser ever made (it is)</li>
		<li><del>Send pipebombs with racial slurs to my mate Matt</del></li>
		<li>Whine about how Mexico City has the best public transport in the world</li>
		<li>Recite whole-ass albums from memory (I'm good at remembering lyrics but not important details of my life!)</li>
		<li>Make "disposable" arguments for no reason outside of causing turmoil</li>
		<li>Browse for houses in sale even though I can't afford any of them</li>
		<li>Develop projects that I will abandon in a week</li>
		<li>Datamine games that I really like (or hate)</li>
		<li>RUSH üêù</li>
		<li>Search for Lost Media (I was part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9YjoSPcyPU">Hitogata</a> search!)</li>
	</ul>
