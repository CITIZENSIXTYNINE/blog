	<h1>Krisp's Contributing Guidelines</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>I had this idea a while ago (about a year), of making my own little set of guidelines for when it comes to me committing/opening PRs or issues/etc, not because I needed them or anything, but because I wanted to provide something for others to see how I like contributing and stuff. Also because I'd like to give some kind of "baseline" that others can then inspire their own contributing guidelines and stuff from.</p>
	<h2>setup</h2>
	<p>First of all, what I refer to as my "setup", is just a pretty simple description of my dev environment. Second, I put this out just for others to see how I do stuff, not as a "hey roast my stuff". I don't care what distro you use, what editor you use, what compiler do you prefer; this is my setup.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>laptop: Huawei Matebook D 15 2020 (AMD)</li>
		<li>distro: Fedora</li>
		<li>browser: Ungoogled Chromium</li>
		<li>editor: Sublime Text</li>
		<li>terminal: gnome-terminal</li>
		<li>shell: zsh + starship</li>
		<li>discord client: Kernel + Cumcord</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>issues and PRs</h2>
	<p>All issues and PRs' titles are labeled at the start with one of the following tags:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>[INFO] - Just information for future issues/PRs to make a reference to, not really reporting a problem or anything.</li>
		<li>[HELP] - Asking for help on something, if on an issue that means the issue is well... an issue; if on a PR this means that help is needed.</li>
		<li>[DISCUSSION] - Starting a discussion on something; only used for issues.</li>
		<li>[SUGGESTION] - For suggestions, similar to discussion but its just for suggestions; only used for issues.</li>
		<li>And more not listed here because I'm writing this while offline...</li>
	</ul>
	<p>And as far as issue/PR etiquette goes, just try to pack as much info into one message/comment, nobody likes having 4 emails from Github because you can't edit a message or attach a video. Also, all issues/PRs (and commits) have to end with "I hope you explode", regardless of context.</p>
	<h2>commits (and PRs to some extent)</h2>
	<p>Look, I don't want my contrib graph looking like <a href="ast/bathroom.png">a fucking bathroom</a>, so I might as well just send one big commit with a lot of code at once, I don't care if I'm gonna have to spend 1 hour of my time fixing merge conflicts or doing code review, I'm not spamming commits for every single change I make.</p>
	<h2>comments (commits)</h2>
	<p>Going along with that entire "one commit > 100 small commits" thing, I always try to explain everything that my gigant commit does in detail via a git comment, I know its odd but at least I'm not throwing a PR called "ehkwrjguhlvrgthugtrjlite" and having the maintainers guess what it does by reading the code.</p>
	<h2>comments (code)</h2>
	<p>I try to make comments only when necessary (ex, code is fucking spaghetti), and even when I do, I'm gonna be humourist about it. All I'm gonna say about this is that comments aren't really something I enjoy being formal about as it's one of those things that don't really matter unless I'm trying to make some kind of glossary to look back in the future, which even then, I'm gonna be really informal about. And most developers won't even see them so I honestly don't care about them.</p>
	<h2>signatures</h2>
	<p>I tend to always sign my commits, you can get a hold of my GPG and SSH keys over at <a href="about.html">my about page</a>. Now, my GPG key may only have 2 emails listed (kris@memeware.net and citizensixtynine@protonmail.com), but in reality I use it for more than just those 2 emails. Here is the list that I hereby approve that I use with this GPG key:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>krisp@riseup.net</li>
		<li>krisnull@cock.li</li>
		<li>nikki@doge-mail.net</li>
		<li>emusk@spacex.com</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Oh and Github's pre-generated key thing from the Web UI/Desktop Client is also approved. And may I add that all my Gitlab/Codeberg commits will always be signed with this key, if you see a commit of mine not signed with this key under these platforms, contact me about it.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>This should be about it when it comes to my entire "contributing guidelines etiquette" endeavours, I'll update this as time goes on but that should be about it.</p>
